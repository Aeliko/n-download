# n-download

This is a troll 'virus' I wrote to trick my friend to download 'n-images' on his computer

## Prerequsities
First edit the `config.ini` to use the 'correct' `website`.

The `search_options` is the one shown in the url bar after you enter keywords in the search bar of 'that website'

The full url is '{`website`}/search/?q={`search_options`}&page='

## Instructions
Run the `testing.py` file. It will download them to `C:/Internet Explorer`, organised by folder

After you decide to forcefully terminate the program using `Ctrl+C`, run `expose.py` to set the covers as wallpapers (Note: it is not tested recently because it is annoying to change back the wallpapers, but it should work on most Windows PCs)
